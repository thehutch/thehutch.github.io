description: My cross-platform C++ game engine

Atom Engine is my custom cross-platform C++ game engine. Atom uses OpenGL3.3+ for rendering and SDL2 for input and window management.

I am currently using Atom for a second year assignment where I have to visually demonstrate the A* pathfinding algorithm and perform a Catmull Spline on the path to show a smooth path.
