Atom Engine is my custom cross-platform C++ game engine. Atom uses OpenGL3.3+ for rendering and SDL2 for input and window handling.

Here you can see a teleporter model (.obj) I have downloaded from the internet and have rendering within Atom. There is currently no lighting applied to models in the scene, but hopefully that will be added in the not to distance future.

I am currently using Atom for a second year assignment where I have to visually demonstrate the A* pathfinding algorithm and perform a Catmull Spline on the path to generate a smooth path.

Here is a link to the [source code](https://github.com/thehutch/Atom) for Atom hosted on Github.
