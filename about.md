I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Central Lancashire, studying Computer Games Development.

I started programming in 2011 when I discovered the Bukkit API for Minecraft. I have since started to learn OpenGL and GLSL and am now working on my own game engine in Java.
In 2013 I began learning C++ before I started University. Since then, I have progressed through the language and am now developing a cross-platform game engine.
