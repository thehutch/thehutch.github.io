Fusion Engine is my custom Java game engine using OpenGL and GLSL.

### Swift Engine
Swift Engine is my custom cross-platform C++ game engine. Swift will support both Windows and Linux and using DirectX and OpenGL respectively.

### University
Whilst at University I have developed some small games. These include a space car racing game and a 3D remake of the 1970's centipede with added features.

### Minecraft Plugins
I started programming in 2011, this is when I became interested in Minecraft and started making a few plugins using the Bukkit API.
